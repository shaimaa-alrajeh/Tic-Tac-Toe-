# Tic Tac Toe - React Application

## Overview

This is a modern, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game results in a draw.

## Features

- Interactive Gameplay: Two-player functionality with dynamic board updates.
- Winner Detection: Automatically determines and displays the winner.
- Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, visually appealing look.
- Reset Functionality: Easy reset to start a new game.
- Real-time Updates: Instantly updates the grid as players make their moves.

## How It Works

1. Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their mark (X or O).
2. The application keeps track of the current player.
3. If a player wins, a message is displayed.
4. If the grid is filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
5. A reset button is provided to clear the board for a new game.
